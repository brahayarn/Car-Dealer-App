# Vehicle Models App

This is a web application that allows users to select a vehicle make and model year, and view the corresponding vehicle models. The app fetches vehicle makes and model details from an external API (NHTSA API). The app is built using **Next.js** and **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Features

- **Vehicle Make Selector**: Select from a list of vehicle makes.
- **Model Year Selector**: Select the model year (from 2015 to the current year).
- **Vehicle Models Display**: Once a make and model year are selected, the app displays a list of available vehicle models for the chosen criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if fetching data fails.
- **Suspense for Loading**: Implements Reactâ€™s `Suspense` for a smooth loading experience.
